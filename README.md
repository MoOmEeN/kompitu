# kompitu
Kompitu is a task manager that will help you keep your tasks in sync.

This is a source code of Windows Store application:
http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/kompitu/ef7cacd1-158a-4334-a1fa-a3b72da42dc4

Since I am (probably - never say never) not going to develop the app any further, this is the source code.
Feel free to fork and improve. Or just take a look and build something better.

Enjoy!
